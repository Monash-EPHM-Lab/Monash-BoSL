Branch Specific Tasklist

Cleanup Code -Notes arduino optimises code at compile time so it is better to have the in air version of the code as a compile option rather than a seperate file.  

Test EC class and ensure gives accurate readings in real life.

Implement Temp and other sensor classes.

Change SensorData interface to work by passing in measurements as arguments, rather than using indices. Pass pointers of Sensor classes to sensorData, no need for main file overhead.
