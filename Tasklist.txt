Branch Specific Tasklist

Test EC class and ensure settling time and pin/cable resistance is well understood on reading effects.

Implement Temp and other sensor classes.

Test SIM7000 code and run test to see if it can log readings on cartridgerefills.com

measure power consumption on everything and create file for it in documentation.

write code documentation


Flip C5 180 degrees
Change to SMD parts
Disconnect joined pads for SIM7000 mount
Remove unused holes
fix pinout on voltage regulator
Add sim7000 pin 1 (pwrkey) pin header
Add alternate names on pin headers (eg: SDA/A5)
Swap for lower frequency crystals (8Mhz)
Label schematics and board better
Correct schematic to PCB board (pin 2/3 go to R/TX instead of 10/11)
Move C5 cap so its not infant of ATMEGA328 (makes prying out chip easier)
Add a USB port for uploading. 
Have a debug switch/ jumper to turn on LED's / USB port (UART to Serial converter)
Have dedicated plug for sensors (ethernet port)
Lots of extra headers for certain pins (3.3v / gnd/ A4/5)
Add transistor switch for 3.3v output for EC sensor & check ADC consistency relative to VCC.
