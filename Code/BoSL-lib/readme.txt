This folder contains the library files for the BoSL code. Copy this folder into Arduino/libraries (follow the instructions for installing a custom library). Then you will be able to run the scripts which depend on the library.

****
If you have the BoSL-lib installed in your Arduino IDE, and also the SensorEC.cpp, SIM7000.cpp, ..., in the your code.ino directory then you will get a COMPILE ERROR. You must remove the copies of the library files if installing as a library.
