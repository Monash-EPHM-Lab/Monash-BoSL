Branch Specific Tasklist

Cleanup Code -Notes arduino optimises code at compile time so it is better to have the in air version of the code as a compile option rather than a seperate file.  

Test EC class and ensure gives accurate readings in real life.

Implement Temp and other sensor classes.

Change SensorData interface to work by passing in measurements as arguments, rather than using indices. 
- Appraoch strategy: Write logData to be a template function and take in any sensor value variable type (int/float/string). Use snprintf to safely store value in dataArray with correct format. Second argument is index for row index, should be defined in main (#define EC 0, ...).
main file will call sensor.getReadings and then pass into dataArray class, more readable and maintainable.

Test SIM7000 with modified botletics code and stable/ battery power supply.
